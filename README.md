# Charlie Dexter ‚Äì GIS Specialist & Software Developer

üëã Hi, I‚Äôm **Charlie Dexter** ‚Äì a GIS Specialist and Software Developer with a passion for spatial problem-solving, process automation, and crafting practical tools that enhance workflows in **ArcGIS Pro** and **ArcGIS Online**.

With experience spanning geospatial analysis, scripting, and custom tool development, I focus on delivering clean, well-documented Python tools and Arcade expressions that help GIS professionals and local government staff get more done with less friction.

## üõ†Ô∏è What You'll Find Here

This repository hosts a growing collection of **free scripts and tools** tailored for **ArcGIS Pro** workflows. These range from address management automation to spatial QA and advanced field calculations.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è All scripts and expressions are provided **free for personal and internal professional use**, but **may not be redistributed, resold, or used commercially** without written permission. See the [License](#-license) section below for more info.

### ‚úÖ Highlights

- **Address Management Tools**  
  Scripts designed to streamline the creation, validation, and formatting of address point features. This includes handling units, syncing with parcel data, and integrating structured address components into clean output.

- **ArcGIS Pro Script Tools**  
  Python-based tools that plug directly into ArcGIS Pro via custom toolboxes. These tools are parameterized for flexibility and built to support local government and infrastructure workflows.

- **Field Calculator Expressions**  
  Pre-built Python and Arcade expressions for use in ArcGIS Pro‚Äôs Field Calculator. These cover tasks like formatting strings, parsing values, and calculating conditional field logic quickly and cleanly.

- **Arcade Expression Examples**  
  Ready-to-use Arcade snippets for smart symbology, labeling, and visibility logic. Built for use in ArcGIS Online and ArcGIS Pro.

- **Batch Processing & QA**  
  Helpful scripts for batch-validating data, checking spatial relationships (like point-in-polygon joins), and automating repetitive QA tasks across feature layers.

## üìÇ How to Use

Most scripts are written in **Python 3.x** and are intended for use in **ArcGIS Pro‚Äôs Python environment**.  
Each tool includes usage notes and example parameters in the comments or accompanying `README` sections in subfolders.

Arcade and field calculator expressions are lightweight and can often be copied directly into ArcGIS Online or Pro with minor tweaks based on your schema.
